# DoctorAppointment
About:
Taking an appointment for a doctor is getting hard now-a-days and it turns even harder when you must go to each hospital physically or check ever website of those hospitals for respective doctors. It is when I thought why not bring them to a single platform where we can easily show the users:
1.	All the doctors with different specializations with in a click distance.
2.	Days and timings the doctor is available.
3.	Book an appointment.
4.	It even makes doctors easy to organize their appointments.

With these ideas in mind I built a web application helps to check for a doctor in respective specialization and book an appointment with the doctor.

Technologies used:
•	Front-end: HTML, CSS.
•	Back-end: JAVA, JSP.
•	Database: Oracle.
