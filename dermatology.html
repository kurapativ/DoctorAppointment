				 <pre><h2>What’s New</h2>: Emerging Medical Technologies and Skin Care Advancements
Dermatology Associates of Atlanta’s Physicians and Providers have over 150 years of collective dermatological experience in providing skin care from head to toe. As leaders in their respective fields, Dr. Edmond Griffin (DAA’s founder), Dr. Scott Karempelis, Dr. Stephen Kraus, Dr. Joseph Payne, Dr. Ashley Curtis and their other providers (PA’s Kathryn Filipek, Mara Grosswald and Delmer Henderson) continue to adopt and refine the latest technologies to ensure their patients the most effective skin and hair treatments possible.

Oxygenetix®: The Heal and Conceal Post-Procedure Foundation
Oxygenetix® is a new product that can change the healing process after full-face laser skin resurfacing. The unique formula combines compounds that promote healing with the coverage capabilities. Oxygenetix® not only serves as a makeup that patients can wear before the usual 5-7 day waiting period after their procedure, but it allows their skin to heal more quickly and smoothly so that they can see the results of their treatment more quickly. As an added bonus, using Oxygenetix® even after the skin has healed may be able to protect and improve skin tone. We offer a wide selection of colors so that you can select the one which best matches your natural skin tone.

Candela UltraShape® System for Fat Reduction
UltraShape® provides instant fat-destroying results by transmitting pulsed ultrasonic energy directly onto problem areas which eradicates fat cells almost upon contact.  Painless, non-invasive UltraShape® is the latest ultrasound treatment available for fat reduction. There is no downtime following the procedure, which is FDA approved and has no reported side effects. Full results are visible between two and four weeks after the first treatment, with maximum effectiveness achieved after two to three treatments. Patients have reported an overall decrease in body circumference of between 3.5 and 6.3 centimeters after completing their recommended number of one-hour UltraShape® sessions.

PicoSure® for Skin Rejuvenation
PicoSure® is moving beyond tattoo removal! Introducing the new Focus Lens Array hand piece for PicoSure®, a hand piece that allows for skin rejuvenation with minimal downtime and discomfort by lessening the appearance of brown pigmentation from sun damage. Early results even show correction for pigmented scars! When joined with the V-Beam Perfecta® Pulsed Dye Laser, we generate a supercharged, collagen-stimulating experience to firm and renew the skin. Stay tuned for before and after pictures!

Infini™ – Infini™ by Lutronic®
Dermatology Associates of Atlanta uses 3-D Micro-Needling Fractional Radio Frequency (MFR) to make the most of wrinkle reduction capability by strictly targeting areas of the skin with precise coagulation. Micro-needling generates production of new collagen by itself, and when radiofrequency (RF) is added, results are maximized. Clinical studies for Infini™ indicate results 49% as effective as a traditional facelift, without the extensive downtime or recovery. By using a heated micro-needling hand piece that produces fractional micro-holes in epidermis, increased levels of RF can be delivered to the dermis with more predictable results than when RF used alone. Infini™ breaks up scar tissue to address acne scarring, fine lines, and light wrinkles. Our physicians can identify and recommend what wrinkle treatments can best accommodate your skincare goals during an in-office consultation.

Vampire Facelift
Dr. Ashley Curtis and Delmer L. Henderson, PA-C  are now performing the Vampire Facelift for facial rejuvenation. This non-surgical procedure promotes new tissue growth to improve facial skin tone for a more youthful appearance. This effective treatment uses blood drawn from the patient which is then spun in a centrifuge to extract platelet rich plasma from their blood. The providers of Dermatology Associates of Atlanta have been using platelet rich plasma for facial rejuvenation and non-invasive hair loss treatment for over 15 years and cosmetic injectables for 35 years.  Platelet rich plasma (PRP) is combined with a facial filler such as Belotero® Balance or Juvéderm®, and then re-injected into areas of concern around the face.  Patients benefit from this procedure as there is minimal downtime and results can last for over a year. For more information about Vampire Facelift™ and other facial rejuvenation procedures at Dermatology Associates of Atlanta, please call our office to schedule an appointment.

Xeomin® for Fine Lines and Wrinkles
Dermatology Associates of Atlanta is now offering FDA-approved Xeomin® cosmetic injectable to reduce the appearance of facial lines between the eyes. Similar to Botox® and Dysport®, this facial aesthetic treatment relaxes nerve endings in muscles to smooth frown lines on the forehead. Typically Xeomin® results last up to three months but may vary for every patient. There is no downtime associated with Xeomin® treatment; however, some patients may experience temporary bruising or swelling. If you are interested in Xeomin® or other cosmetic injectables, please contact our office to schedule an appointment.

Restylane® Silk by Galderma
Restylane® Silk is the first and only dermal filler approved by the FDA to enhance lip fullness as well as smooth fine lines and wrinkles around the mouth. As we age, the fat and collagen in our face begins to diminish, causing a loss of youthful facial volume and, in some cases, a loss of volume in the lips. Restylane® Silk addresses both issues, by adding a natural-looking fullness to the lips while also helping to minimize the appearance of wrinkles, specifically “smile lines” between the lips and nose. According to clinical trials, the effects of Restylane® Silk can last up to six months after injection.

PicoSure™ for Tattoo Removal
The providers of Dermatology Associates of Atlanta are now offering the latest FDA-approved PicoSure™ laser for removal of tattoos and benign pigmented lesions at their Laser Institute of Georgia center. This advanced laser system disperses shorter bursts of energy compared to the current nanosecond lasers, allowing for more efficient results. Fewer treatments and the ability to remove darker ink tattoos is what makes this new laser tattoo removal technology better than any other on the market today. Not only does thePicoSure™ laser reduce the amount of treatments needed for tattoo removal, it is also very effective in removing dark pigments like green and blue. Through PressureWave™ technology, targeted ink is shattered into tiny particles providing patients with fewer treatments and reduced risk of injury to surrounding skin. If you are interested in PicoSure™ or other laser services, please contact our office to schedule an appointment.

PicoWay for Tattoo Removal
The providers of Dermatology Associates of Atlanta are now offering the latest FDA-approved PicoWay laser for removal of tattoos and benign pigmented lesions at their Laser Institute of Georgia Center. This advanced laser system disperses shorter bursts of energy compared to the current nanosecond lasers and utilizes dual wavelengths, allowing for more efficient results. Fewer treatments and the ability to remove darker ink tattoos is what makes this new laser tattoo removal technology better than any other on the market today. Not only does the PicoWay laser reduce the amount of treatments needed for tattoo removal, it is also very effective in removing dark tattoos from dark-skinned patients. Through photoacoustic fracturing technology, targeted ink is shattered into tiny particles which are then naturally eliminated by the body, providing patients with fewer treatments and reduced risk of injury to surrounding skin. If you are interested in PicoWay or other laser services, please contact our office to schedule an appointment.

Belotero® Balance for Facial Rejuvenation
Dermatology Associates of Atlanta is offering a new FDA-approved dermal filler option for patients looking to smooth wrinkles and lines. Belotero Balance® is a facial filler that uses a cohesive gel to restore areas of lost volume including nasolabial folds and correct moderate to severe facial wrinkles. Patients benefit from this facial filler as it provides instant results. Typically, patients’ results last about six months. Belotero is not approved for lip injections and can carry minimal side effects including swelling, redness, and inflammation. If you are interested in Belotero Balance® or the other facial rejuvenation treatments we offer, please contact our office for additional information.

Juvéderm® Voluma™ XC
Dermatology Associates of Atlanta is proud to announce the addition of Juvéderm® Voluma™ XC to our lineup of facial fillers. Much like Juvéderm® XC, the filler consists of hyaluronic acid and lidocaine, a local anesthetic, to lessen patient discomfort. While facial fillers are commonly administered to areas of the face such as the nose and mouth, Voluma™ specifically lifts all areas of the cheeks for facial rejuvenation results lasting up to two years. The newest FDA-approved filler from Allergan®, Voluma™ addresses all three areas of the cheek to provide a youthful lift that subtly but effectively rejuvenates the face.

If you are interested in Juvéderm® Voluma™ XC or the other facial rejuvenation treatments we offer, please contact our office for additional information.

NeoGraft for Hair Transplantation
The Griffin Center for Hair Restoration and Research is now offering NeoGraft, an automated method for follicular unit extraction (FUE). This procedure individually extracts one follicular unit at a time. The FUE treatment leaves no linear scars in the donor area and is ideal for patients who tend to scar easily. Since each follicle is individually extracted with this technique, it can be time consuming and costly. NeoGraft is an automated hair transplant device that assists the FUE technique for hair restoration. Unlike all other forms of FUE, patients benefit from this treatment because it takes less time and can potentially decrease mechanical injury to the grafts since it doesn’t require forceps during extraction. Though the technology is automated, NeoGraft procedures at the Griffin Center for Hair Restoration and Research are supervised by Dr. Edmond Griffin, hair restoration surgeon with 35 years experience.

If you are interested in learning more about hair loss treatments please contact our office to set up a consultation.

miraDry® for Underarm Sweating
Underarm sweating can lead to embarrassing social situations, ruined clothes, strong body odor, and can affect your day to day life. Dermatology Associates of Atlanta is here to help and permanently stop, axillary hyperhidrosis, or excessive sweating of the underarms. We are the first in Atlanta to now offer a non-invasive procedure for underarm sweating. The FDA approved miraDry® system uses microwave technology to deliver precisely controlled electromagnetic energy to the area under the arm where sweat glands reside. Sweat glands are eliminated by the heat and since sweat glands do not regenerate, the results are permanent. The miraDry® procedure is performed over two in office treatments, between a three month period, under local anesthesia, each lasting approximately one hour. The non-invasive technology’s unique cooling system protects overlying skin and helps maximize patient comfort during treatment. There is little to no downtime required after the miraDry® procedure so patients can continue their normal routines after treatment.

If you are interested in learning more about the miraDry® system please contact our office today to set up a consultation.

New Liposuction (Fat Reduction) Technology
SlimLipo™- Removes excess fat and tightens skin in just one step. Similar to SmartLipo technology,SlimLipo™ liquefies fat cells to allow for easier removal; however, the dual wavelengths in the SlimLipo™ system also target collagen fibers and actually tighten the skin while also removing the unwanted fat. Dermatology Associates of Atlanta is proud to be one of the few providers in Georgia to offer SlimLipo™. Fat reduction can be achieved in just one session, and the minimally invasive nature of this technology significantly reduces patient downtime.

Visit our liposuction page or contact our Cosmetic Center to learn more about SlimLipo™.

New Skin Firming Technology
Ultherapy® Facial Skin Tightening- Ultrasound is used to visualize the deeper layers of dermal tissue in need of rejuvenation. After the face and neck have been mapped out, Ulthera® technology concentrates ultrasound energy to the needed areas. The applied energy heats the underlying layers of tissue to tighten the appearance of skin on the face and neck. The heat also increases collagen production, a process naturally slowed by age, allowing the skin to continue rejuvenation for months after the treatment. Most Ulthera® skin tightening patients notice visible improvement in skin laxity and volume after just one treatment.

To learn more and read answers to your frequently asked questions about this non-surgical skin tightening procedure for the face and neck visit our Ultherapy® page.

New Vein Elimination Technology
Veinwave™— Eliminates unwanted spider veins on the face or legs by using electrical vein-eliminating technology to reduce the unwanted vessels in one or two applications. Unlike sclerotherapy, which requires injections to target the vessels, Veinwave™ treatment is applied subepidermally (only penetrating the top layer). This treatment is suitable for all skin types and tones.

Visit the Atlanta Center for Vein’s page for more information on vein removal at Dermatology Associates of Atlanta.

New Fat Reduction Technology- CoolSculpting
CoolSculpting®— Sandwiches tissue between the hand piece to apply cold to targeted areas of unwanted fat of the abdomen, hips, or back. Unlike surgical fat reduction like liposuction, the cold damages the fat cells externally and the body slowly expels them through the lymphatic system to refine the patient’s silhouette. Most Atlanta CoolSculpting patients report a 20% fat reduction following their first treatment.

Visit Atlanta Cosmetic Surgery Center’s page for more information on fat reduction at Dermatology Associates of Atlanta.

Hair Loss Technology
Red Light Treatment— Low dose LED therapy that encourages hair growth after a hair transplantprocedure as well as strengthening weekend growth or hair thinning.

Botox® for Hair Loss— Injections of purified botulinum to promote hair growth in patients with pattern baldness. Botox® can also be used to soften and prevent scar tissue from forming around donor regions used for hair transplant surgery.
